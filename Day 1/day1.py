#Today is day 1 of my 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp course. April 6th 2022
print("hello world")
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("Hello world!")
#print function follows parentheses, inside the parentheses you tell it what you want to print.
#in order to tell computer that something is not code, you need to use quotes
#Strings: a line of characters, with the quotes showing beginning and end of the string of characters
#if you don't have the ending quotes, the ending parenthesis will not be the same color as the beginning parenthesis 
#if you come across a red error, copy and paste the error into google, with stackoverflow.com usually having an answer
#OK, the first assignement she gave us is through Coding Rooms, and the input is the following:
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")
#I got the answer correct on the first try!
#using double quotes or single quotes doesn't matter for printing
print('hello')
#however, if you want to have a quote inside a quote, you need to use the single quote inside the double quote, so that the computer knows where your strings are. If you used a double quote then another double quote, it would think your string is the print and the function/code comes after the first double quote.
