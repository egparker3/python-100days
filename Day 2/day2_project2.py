#she had us do a BMI calculator and this is what I came up with

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

#bmi = weight/height^2
#height and weight are strings

height_float = float(height)
weight_float = float(weight)

bmi = int(weight_float / (height_float ** 2))

print(bmi)
